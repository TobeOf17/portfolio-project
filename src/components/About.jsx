          <p>
            I'm a developer with a passion for creating clean, functional, and
            user-friendly web applications. I enjoy solving problems and bringing
            ideas to life through code. I have a noticeable preference for modularity in code and 
            minimalistic design principles.
          </p>

          <p>
            My focus is on building responsive, accessible websites that provide
            great user experiences. I'm constantly learning new technologies and
            improving my craft.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you can find me active in my community,
            exploring nature, or indulging in my love for sports.
